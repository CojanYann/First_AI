## CNN predicts age and gender
- To use this repository you need a Kaggle account and if you don't have a GPU I recommend using Google Colab.
- Create your CNN using model_script or Copy_of_model_script180v2 and upload it to your machine in a new repository named "Model"
- You can then use APP180 to take a picture of yourself and predict your age and gender
